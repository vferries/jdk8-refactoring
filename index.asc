== Lambdas
* Single Asbtract Method / Functional Interface
* at compile time -> anonymous classes
* first code sample : refactor a runnable call

[source,java]
Runnable job = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello EclipseCon");
    }
};

Becomes:

[source,java]
Runnable job = () -> {
    System.out.println("Hello EclipseCon");
};

With two key strokes.

* Frameworks with events greatly eased
* GWT made easy

== Streams
* Collections
